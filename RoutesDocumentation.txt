1) The URL can be set in a few ways:

*) The user loads the app for the first time.
*) The user changes the URL manually, such as by clicking the back button or by editing the address bar.
*) The user clicks a link within the app.
*) Some other event in the app causes the URL to change.

2) Transitioning Between Routes

*) From a template, use <LinkTo> as mentioned above
*) From a route, use the transitionTo() method
*) From a controller, use the transitionToRoute() method
*) From anywhere else in your application, such as a component, inject the Router Service and use the transitionTo() method
