1) Unit Tests

Unit Tests are useful for testing pure functions where the return value is only determined by its input values, without any observable side effects.

2) Container Tests

If we need to test the functionality around an Ember class instance, such as a Controller, Service, or Route, we can use a container test to do that by setting up the application's container.

3) Rendering Tests

If we need to test the interactions between various parts of the application, such as behavior between UI controls we can utilize Rendering Tests.

4) Application Tests

Finally if we are looking to test user interaction and application flow in order to verify user stories or a feature from an end-user perspective, we can use Application Tests. In these kinds of tests, we interact with the application in the same ways that a user would, such as filling out form fields and clicking buttons.
